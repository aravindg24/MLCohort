# Task-1 :
    
    ○ Download the test images from this Kaggle dataset, and place them all in a folder
    ○ Define a function in the jupyter notebook to do the following tasks:
        ■ Input: Takes the path of the folder as the input
        ■ Process:
              ● Loads all the images and convert them to an array
              ● Convert all the images to grayscale images
        ■ Output:
              ● Number of images
              ● Format type of the images
              ● Saving all the grayscale images to another folder

# Task-2 :
    
    1. Download the data from the link here
    2. Write a function in python script to do the following:
      i. Inputs: Input the folder name and csv filename through command line
      ii. To-Do:
            1. Read all the images
            2. Read the csv file, and get the image label names and coordinates
            3. Draw the bounding boxes for every image, using thecorresponding image’s coordinates (Use different colour and
               thickness for the bounding boxes)
            4. Add labels for every image (Use different font, font colour, font
               size)
            5. Create another folder and save all the images to the folder
            6. Push the code to GitHub, and show few samples of the before and
               after on the Readme.md file.
